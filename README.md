# Student CRUD Operation – Spring Boot Application

## Project Description
The **Student CRUD Operation** project is a Spring Boot–based web application designed to demonstrate the implementation of basic **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)** operations on student data. The application provides a simple and structured way to manage student records using RESTful web services and modern backend development practices.

This system allows users to **add new student records**, **view existing student details**, **update student information**, and **delete student records** from the database. The project follows a layered architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and clean separation of concerns.
